## Embedded Computer Systems
This folder consists of programs built for projects utilizing the TM4C123GH6PM microcontroller. These projects include: developing drivers for input and output peripherals, intefacing through a databus and SSI, using periodic driven interrupts, controlling a DC motor through PWM, creating a digital to analog converter, designing an ohmmeter, etc. This course also allowed me to troubleshoot projects through hardware (oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, function generators, etc.) and software debugging techniques, as well as increased my ability to understand datasheets.
