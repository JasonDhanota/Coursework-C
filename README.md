# Coursework-C
This repository consists of programs utilizing the C programming language. For access to view the code, please send me an email requesting an invitation to the private repository.

## Embedded Computer Systems
This folder consists of programs built for projects utilizing the TM4C123GH6PM microcontroller. These projects include: developing drivers for input and output peripherals, intefacing through a databus and SSI, using periodic driven interrupts, controlling a DC motor through PWM, creating a digital to analog converter, designing an ohmmeter, etc. This course also allowed me to troubleshoot projects through hardware (oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, function generators, etc.) and software debugging techniques, as well as increased my ability to understand datasheets. 

## Operating Systems
This folder consists of programs that include a simple UNIX shell, multithreaded applications, a simple kernel module, etc. Other topics that were covered include process/thread creation and scheduling, memory management, file systems, I/O device drivers, etc. 

## Parallel Programming
This folder consists of programs that include matrix multiplication, parallel sorting, and implementation of the Monte Carlo method using MPI, pthreads, and OpenMP. Other topics that were covered include distributed memory versus shared memory, caching, and parallel hardware architecture.
